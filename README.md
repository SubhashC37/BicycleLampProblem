# BicycleLampProblem
Design the software to control a simple LED based bicycle lamp. There are 2 buttons on the lamp. 
Button 1 switches the lamp from off to on red.
Pressing Button 1 a second time causes the lamp to flash red. Pressing button 1 a third time switches the lamp to off. 
Pressing button 2 toggles the colour of the lamp from red to white or white to red.
